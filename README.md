# IBM-HR-Analytics-Employee-Attrition-Performance
The IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition &amp; Performance dataset from the Kaggle. I have first performed Exploratory Data Analysis on the data using  various libraries like pandas,seaborn,matplotlib etc.. Then I have plotted used feature selection techniques like RFE to select the features.  The data is then oversampled using the SMOTE technique in order to deal with the imbalanced classes. Also the data is then scaled for better performance. Lastly I have trained many ML models from the scikit-learn library for predictive modelling and compared the performance using Precision, Recall and other metrics.
